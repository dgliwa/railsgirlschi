%h2 Guidelines
%p
  Encourage your team to <strong>not</strong> copy-paste the code-snippets.  They will have a much better learning experience if they manually type in the code.

%h2 Installation
%p
  Follow the <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/" target="new">Girls Rails installation guide</a>.
%p
  Alternatively you can use <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/" target="new">nitrous.io</a> or <a href="https://c9.io/">cloud9</a>
%h2 Expectations while Programming
%p
  You will have bugs in your code, you will make mistakes, this is normal while writing software. Learning from mistakes and issues is part of the programming experience.
  Typos and other issues are expected. Don't get discouraged.
